# poem-generator
poem generator is an application that uses DeepLearning in order to generate poem.
our model uses LSTM which is a variant of rnn's, using LSTM solve the vanshing gradient problem.
# how to run it:
there is two ways to use it:<br/>
1-colab<br/>
2-locally<br/>
if you're using colab just upload the ipynb file and run it<br/>
locally:<br/>
1-you have to install python 3<br/>
2-the recommended libraries<br/>
3-install ide and open the .py file or .ipynb<br/>
4-run it
# the recommended libraries:
1-sci-learn<br/>
2-keras<br/>
3-numpy<br/>
4-pandas<br/>
5-matplotlib
